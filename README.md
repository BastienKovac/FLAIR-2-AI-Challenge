## Context & Data

The FLAIR #2 dataset is sampled countrywide and is composed of over 20 billion annotated pixels, acquired over three years and different months (spatio-temporal domains). It consists of very high resolution aerial imagery patches with 5 channels (RVB-Near Infrared-Elevation) and annotation (19 semantic classes or 13 for the baselines). High resolution Sentinel-2 1-year time series with 10 spectral band are also provided on the same areas with broader extents.

## Baseline model 

A two-branches architecture integrating a U-Net with a pre-trained ResNet34 encoder and a U-TAE encompassing a temporal self-attention encoder is presented. The U-TAE branch aims at learning spatio-temporal embeddings from the high resolution satellite time series that are further integrated into the U-Net branch exploiting the aerial imagery. The proposed _U-T&T_ model features a fusion module to exploit and shape the U-TAE embeddings towards the U-Net branch.
